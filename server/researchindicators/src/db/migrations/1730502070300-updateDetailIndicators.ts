  <div class="indicator-title">Policy or strategy</div>
  <div class="indicator-description"><br />Policies or strategies include written decisions on, or commitments to, a particular course of action by an institution (policy); or a (government, NGO, private sector) high-level plan outlining how a particular course of action will be carried out (strategy). These documents show the intent of an organization or entity. Examples are country growth strategies, country agricultural policies, organization strategic plans or road maps. This could also be observed as information campaigns (e.g., for improved diets). These documents set the goalposts but then require other instruments for implementation.<br /><br /><br /></div>
  <div class="indicator-title">Legal instrument</div>
  <div class="indicator-description"><br />Legal instruments include laws, which are defined as Bills passed into law by the highest elected body (a parliament, congress or equivalent); or regulations, which are defined as rules or norms adopted by a government. These laws and regulations dictate very specifically actions and behaviors that are to be followed or prohibited and often include language on implications of non-compliance.<br /><br /><br /></div>
  <div class="indicator-title">Program, budget or investment</div>
  <div class="indicator-description"><br />These are implementing mechanisms that often follow from a strategy, policy or law. There is typically a well-defined set of actions outlined over a specific period of time and with a specific budgetary amount attached. National Agricultural Investment Plans is an example, the budget within a ministry is another, investments from the private sector fit here, as well as programs launched by public, private and NGO sectors.</div>

    Maturity refers to the stage of an Outcome Impact Case Report (OICR).<br /><br />
    Level 1: (sphere of influence) CGIAR research (and related activities) has contributed to changed discourse and/or behavior among next users (related to the theory of change). Examples of evidence: outcome mapping study, media analysis, e-mail correspondence.<br /><br />
    Level 2: (sphere of influence) CGIAR research (and related activities) has contributed to documented policy change and/or a change in practice by end users. This may include changes such as income, nutrient intake etc. in the sphere of influence - usually this will be a development project involved in ‘delivery’/scaling up of an innovation. Example of evidence: a study of adoption and effects, commissioned at project level.<br /><br />
    Level 3: (sphere of interest) Policy and/or practice changes influenced by CGIAR research (and related activities) has led to adoption or impacts at scale or beyond the direct CGIAR sphere of influence (i.e. not in a development project). Example of evidence: at scale Adoption Study or ex-post Impact Assessment.
