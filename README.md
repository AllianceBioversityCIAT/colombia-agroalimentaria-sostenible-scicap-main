## Backend API Tech Stack

### Programming language

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers static type checking, which enhances code quality and developer productivity. TypeScript provides type safety and better tooling for building robust backend applications. Alternatives: JavaScript lacks static typing, which can lead to more runtime errors.

### Framework

Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and follows modular architecture principles. Nest.js provides built-in support for dependency injection, middleware, and decorators, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs. Alternatives: Express.js is another popular framework, but Nest.js offers more structure and features out of the box.

### Build tool

TypeScript Compiler (tsc) is the official TypeScript compiler that translates TypeScript code into JavaScript. It checks for syntax errors and emits clean JavaScript code. tsc is the standard build tool for TypeScript projects and seamlessly integrates with TypeScript workflows. Alternatives: Babel can also transpile TypeScript code, but tsc is preferred for its close integration with TypeScript.

### Code coverage tool

Istanbul is a code coverage tool for JavaScript applications. It instruments code to track which parts have been executed during testing. Istanbul provides accurate code coverage metrics and integrates well with testing frameworks like Jest. Alternatives: Blanket.js is another code coverage tool, but Istanbul is more widely used and supported.

### Static code analysis

ESLint is a highly configurable static analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. It enforces consistent coding styles and helps catch errors early. ESLint offers extensive customization options and supports TypeScript out of the box. Alternatives: TSLint is deprecated in favor of ESLint for TypeScript projects.

### Dependency management

npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It manages dependencies and facilitates package installation, versioning, and dependency resolution. npm has a vast ecosystem of packages and is tightly integrated with Node.js development workflows. Alternatives: Yarn is another package manager, but npm is preferred for its widespread adoption and compatibility.

### Dependency vulnerability scanning

npm Audit is a built-in feature of npm that scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities. It provides actionable insights and recommendations for securing the application. npm Audit seamlessly integrates with npm and provides comprehensive vulnerability scanning without additional setup. Alternatives: Snyk offers similar functionality but requires additional configuration and integration.

### Unit testing

Jest is a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications. It provides a delightful testing experience with features like snapshot testing, mocking, and code coverage. Jest offers an all-in-one solution for unit testing with built-in assertion libraries and comprehensive test reporting. Alternatives: Mocha requires additional configuration and setup compared to Jest.

### API testing framework

Supertest is a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP servers in Node.js. It provides a fluent API for making HTTP requests and assertions. Supertest integrates well with testing frameworks like Jest and provides a simple and expressive syntax for API testing. Alternatives: Postman offers similar functionality but is more suitable for manual testing and API documentation.

### API documentation

Swagger is an open-source framework for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs. It provides tools for generating interactive API documentation from OpenAPI specifications. Swagger simplifies API documentation by automatically generating documentation from code annotations and comments. Alternatives: RAML and API Blueprint are alternatives to Swagger but are less widely adopted.

### Cross-Functional Requirements

#### Scalability

Description: The system should be able to handle increasing loads and user traffic without compromising performance or availability.

Best Practices:

- Use auto-scaling features provided by AWS Elastic Beanstalk to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.
- Implement efficient caching mechanisms to reduce the load on backend services.

Example: The system automatically scales up during peak hours and scales down during periods of low activity.

Tools: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Auto Scaling, Redis for caching.

#### Security

Description: The system should ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and resources.

Best Practices:

- Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest using SSL/TLS and encryption at the database level.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive resources.

Example: User authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Tools: AWS Cognito, AWS IAM, SSL/TLS certificates, AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

#### Reliability

Description: The system should be highly reliable, with minimal downtime and disruptions.

Best Practices:

- Implement fault-tolerant architecture with redundancy at different levels of the system.
- Set up automated backups and disaster recovery mechanisms for critical data and services.

Example: The system is designed to withstand hardware failures and network outages without impacting user experience.

Tools: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS RDS Multi-AZ deployment, AWS Backup.

#### Performance

Description: The system should deliver fast response times and low latency for user requests.

Best Practices:

- Optimize frontend and backend code for efficiency and speed.
- Use content delivery networks (CDNs) to cache and deliver static assets closer to users.

Example: The average response time for API requests is under 100 milliseconds.

Tools: Performance monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch, New Relic, CDN providers like AWS CloudFront.

#### Maintainability

Description: The system should be easy to maintain, update, and troubleshoot.

Best Practices:

- Follow coding standards and best practices for clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Use automation for deployment, testing, and infrastructure management.

Example: The system architecture is well-documented, and changes can be easily understood and implemented by the development team.

Tools: Code quality tools like ESLint, automated testing frameworks like Jest, infrastructure as code tools like AWS CloudFormation.

#### Monitoring

Description: The system should provide comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to track performance, detect issues, and troubleshoot problems.

Best Practices:

- Set up centralized logging to capture and analyze logs from different components of the system.
- Use monitoring tools to monitor key metrics, set up alerts, and respond to incidents proactively.

Example: The system generates alerts when CPU utilization exceeds a certain threshold or when error rates increase.

Tools: AWS CloudWatch, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Prometheus.

#### Cost Optimization

Description: The system should be cost-effective, with efficient resource utilization and minimal waste.

Best Practices:

- Optimize resource provisioning based on actual usage and demand patterns.
- Use cost management tools to analyze spending, identify cost-saving opportunities, and optimize resource allocation.

Example: Unused resources are identified and decommissioned to reduce costs without impacting performance.

Tools: AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Trusted Advisor, Cloud cost optimization platforms like CloudHealth.

#### High Availability

Description: The system should ensure continuous availability and resilience to failures.

Best Practices:

- Deploy resources across multiple availability zones (AZs) to distribute traffic and mitigate single points of failure.
